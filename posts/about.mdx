Starting a tech blog is often suggested as a way to establish your career in the industry. However, when comparing my knowledge to that of some of the insightful tech blogs I've read, I'm unsure if I can offer a level of genuine benefit. Nevertheless, I'm opening this door on my site (possibly distributed via an email service in the future) for three reasons:

## To Improve My Writing

Writing is an invaluable skill that brings clarity and attention. It helps to solidify your understanding and provides a unique perspective. How does one acquire such a treasured skill? Like most skills, by practicing. This blog will naturally encourage me to process my thoughts and write, with the added advantage of being public. Unlike books that take years to complete, blog posts can improve at a faster pace.

## To Express My Disillusionment and Excitement in the Tech Space

Even as a junior developer, I've witnessed significant changes in the web development landscape. It has taken detours, veered off course, and then returned numerous times. These shifts can be observed in design trends and the ongoing debate between client-side and server-side rendering, especially with the recent updates in React and Next.js. However, not all changes are positive, and certain advancements may evoke fear or disappointment. While it may not be the most conventional thing to express, I believe it's a valid part of the bigger picture. Drawing from my experience as a self-releasing musician, I've seen the music industry undergo frequent and transformative changes every six months or so. I feel well-suited for such turbulence, possibly due to my background in a pilot family. Although I don't claim to possess superior knowledge about how we arrived at this point in the web, as an individual who spends a significant amount of time online, I believe my thoughts and perspectives hold value.

## To Further Solidify My Technical Understanding

Although learning programming and web frameworks fascinates me and deepens my understanding of the world and the tools we use, I've never been particularly technical or academic. Learning, while one of the best ways to invest time, can sometimes feel slow and arduous. Perhaps it's a result of neurodivergence, years of having tunnel vision for music, or even sheer laziness. But what's the next step? It's moving forward, by any means necessary! I believe that one such means could be expressing concepts I didn't immediately grasp in a blog format.

Thank you for taking the time to read this. I hope this blog proves to be useful and used. If not, I'm sure I had a valid reason for attempting it.
