## Introduction

As a developer, my journey has largely been a solitary one. Although shaped by my collaboration experiences in a coding bootcamp and my initial six months of professional work but I have largely honed my understanding of the development landscape by immersing myself in the insights and experiences shared by industry leaders, both through online resources and the wisdom of seasoned developers found in blogs and books. However, it has become increasingly apparent to everyone, from parents to children, that the democratization of AI has introduced a sense of unease surrounding job security within our field. In this article, I will explore the evolving relationship between developers and AI, examining its implications for our profession.

## The Need for Adaptation

As my understanding of programming languages advanced at a pace tailored to my own preferences, I took pride in my progress, even as I shunned traditional academia. I quickly discovered that developers who excel don't rely solely on memorizing syntax. Instead, they possess a mental model of the software they write and have the ability to navigate the vast online landscape to seek assistance when needed. Imagine being stuck on a particularly complex bug and spending hours scrolling through search engine results, trying to find the right article or code snippet that offers a solution. It can be a frustrating experience, requiring a deep understanding of our work and the ability to formulate precise queries to get the desired outcome.

## Leveraging AI as a Tool

In my pursuit of a more efficient workflow, I turned to ChatGPT, an AI model that offers assistance in the form of natural language interactions. With ChatGPT, I can express my coding problems in whatever fragmented language I can muster during moments of frustration. While it may not always provide the exact answer I seek, it unfailingly offers a guiding light, pointing me in the right direction. ChatGPT has been invaluable in helping me with syntax-related questions, providing quick assistance when I need to recall the proper usage of a specific language feature or library. It acts as a reliable companion, guiding me towards relevant resources and giving me a nudge in the right direction.

## The Limitations of AI

Despite its benefits, AI has its limitations. ChatGPT, for instance, has a data cutoff of late 2021. Since then, newer frameworks such as TypeScript, React, and Next.js have evolved significantly. These technologies, while relatively new, are still refining their patterns for improved developer experience and performance. Consequently, relying solely on AI is not advisable if we want the best code for our projects. It's important to acknowledge that AI tools like ChatGPT might not always provide the most up-to-date or context-specific answers, particularly in rapidly evolving frameworks or complex problem domains. It's crucial to balance AI assistance with cultivating a deep understanding of the underlying concepts and investing in continuous learning.

## Navigating the Frontiers of AI

During my journey, I had the opportunity to explore GitHub AI through a trial. It proved to be helpful in addressing syntactical concerns, providing assistance within the realm of its knowledge. I used it in projects, skipping through complexities in areas I'm less confident in, such as tRPC or in reviewing multiple ways functions can be written, comparing their benefits and drawbacks. However, when my trial ran up, I actually had a sense of relief. These tools would benefit me in working on a large project or if my responsibilities as a developer were towering over me, but presently, they're not. At my stage, I need to approach code slowly, full-screen the IDE, understand each line left to right, right to left. I should be cmd-tabbing back to documentation often to solidify my understanding, even if that information is found via a guiding light from ChatGPT. It is important to approach AI as a tool rather than a comprehensive solution. It offers shortcuts and automation, but it cannot replace the depth of understanding and expertise that developers bring to their craft.

## Embracing AI as a Power Tool

A great inspiration to me recently, [Sam Selikoff](https://twitter.com/samselikoff), eloquently described the advent of AI as akin to power tools for developers in the [Frontend First podcast](https://frontendfirst.fm). AI can expedite our work and enhance productivity. However, it's essential to remember that AI should complement our expertise rather than replace it. As developers, we must continuously update our knowledge, adapt to new technologies, and foster a deep understanding of the tools we work with. In the next ten years, as AI continues to advance, engineers in various fields will remain invaluable. While AI can automate tasks and processes, engineers' expertise, domain knowledge, and problem-solving skills will be crucial. They possess a deep understanding of their fields, allowing them to make informed decisions and ensure proper AI application. Engineers play a vital role in designing and developing AI systems, optimizing their performance, and aligning them with ethical standards. Their critical thinking and creativity enable them to address complex challenges and bridge the gap between AI technologies and end-users. Despite AI's capabilities, engineers' contributions are essential for driving innovation and creating a better future.

## Conclusion

AI has undoubtedly reshaped the developer's landscape, offering unprecedented assistance in problem-solving and knowledge acquisition. However, it's crucial to acknowledge the limitations of AI tools and embrace them as complementary rather than all-encompassing solutions. By combining the benefits of AI tools like ChatGPT with a commitment to continuous learning and deep understanding, we can navigate the complexities of development with confidence. Let us embrace AI as a powerful ally while nurturing our skills and staying adaptable to the changing demands of our profession. In doing so, we can ensure job security and professional growth in this dynamic era.
