# Starting University Again

Embarking on a formal education journey often brings about a mixture of emotions, from excitement to trepidation. I know this all too well. As a teenager, I was so fixated on music that the idea of structured learning felt constrictive, almost alien. This led me to drop out of music university after just a year—there was a rigidness to the path it laid out that didn’t sit right with me.

For several years, I treaded water, living modestly off Spotify earnings. It was a time filled with creativity but also discomfort. Despite this, computing lingered in my mind—like a distant melody that refuses to fade. To me, computing seemed a discipline for the logically minded, and I felt I might not fit the bill. This perception changed when I took a plunge into a coding bootcamp. It wasn't just about learning to code; it expanded my self-conception. Coding felt right, like finding a new chord progression that resonates deep within.

An interesting stint in a contract development job followed. It was illuminating, but I knew it wasn't the launchpad I needed. My thirst for knowledge was unquenched, and so, university became the new chapter. At the start of the year, Auckland University of Technology welcomed me as I embarked on a double major in Data Science and Software Development.

There's a certain clarity in the university atmosphere that I find comforting. It reminds me of my first day in music school and that same sensation at the coding bootcamp. So far, it's been a positive experience. The transition requires a reframing of life's lens and grappling with the occasional disconnection from the immediate applicability of the work.

Maths, in particular, is a subject I grapple with. As someone a few years removed from high school and who once struggled with Year 11 maths, the abstraction can sometimes feel untethered from its purpose. Yet, when I manage to anchor myself to its relevance “for computing,” the fog clears.

Database design is a course that has become my unexpected favourite. Navigating database solutions feels like exploring uncharted territories, having dabbled with SQL and MongoDB previously. My time interning at Spark flashed back—the clarity of purpose everyone else seemed to possess now begins to crystallise for me as well.

As for the Computing Technology in Society class, I'm captivated by the historical insights but remain adrift on the course's intent. It seems to oscillate between providing context and mandating archaic calculations that seem divorced from modern utility.

The Programming Concepts and Techniques course, while enjoyable, strikes me as slightly askew in balance. Were I self-studying, I'd probably dive into Brian Kernighan's writings on C and tinker with applications. However, there's an elegance to how knowledge unfolds weekly at university that self-study can't replicate.

I plan to chronicle this journey, though not without reservations. Writing about personal experiences runs the risk of seeming self-centred, but I believe this introspection is necessary. It's a counterbalance to derealisation, a beacon for honest self-evaluation, and a way to stay tethered to the real-time impact of my education. Let's see where this sail takes me.
